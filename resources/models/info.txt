Models with UV-Mapping:
- sphere_new.obj
- sphere_new_fromcube.obj

These sphere models are not provided by the framework.
They are smoother and use another kind of UV-Mapping,
fixing the weird rotated texture bug that
occurs using the provided sphere model.


test_monkey.obj
is the default Blender Suzanne Model.
It does NOT contain UV-mapping!
The model was added to test lighting properties like reflection.
